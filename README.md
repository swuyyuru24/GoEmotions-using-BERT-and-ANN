Emotion Detection for Social Media Data using Deep Learning
This repository contains code and resources related to the project "Emotion Detection for Social Media Data using Deep Learning". The objective of this project was to create a robust model for multi-label text classification using deep learning algorithms applied to the GoEmotions dataset. The dataset consists of more than 58,000 Reddit comments labeled with 27 different emotions.

Project Overview
Objective: Develop a model to accurately identify and categorize text into one or more emotions present in the GoEmotions dataset.
Dataset: GoEmotions dataset containing 58k Reddit comments labeled with 27 emotions.
Techniques Used: Deep learning algorithms including ANNs (Artificial Neural Networks) and BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers).
Performance Evaluation: Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score were used to evaluate model performance.
Repository Structure
data/: Contains the GoEmotions dataset used in the project.
code/: Includes code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
results/: Stores results and performance metrics of trained models.
docs/: Documentation and resources related to the project.
Getting Started
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/emotion-detection.git
cd emotion-detection
Set up the environment:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Explore the Jupyter notebooks in the code/ directory for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

Run the notebooks to reproduce the results or train your own models.

Results
The fine-tuned BERT model outperformed the fine-tuned ANN model in terms of accuracy and validation loss.
Detailed results and performance metrics can be found in the results/ directory.
Future Scope
Experiment with larger datasets and more complex deep learning architectures.
Explore additional pre-processing techniques and hyperparameter tuning for improved model performance.
Extend the application of emotion detection models to social media monitoring and consumer feedback analysis.
